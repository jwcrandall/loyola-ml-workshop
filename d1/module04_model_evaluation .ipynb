    "\n",
    "* Verifying and validating the learning approach/pipeline/model\n",
    "* Deploying the ML model\n",
    "\n",
    "Verifying the model always involves a training and testing dataset and frequently a validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The training, testing, and validation datasets are drawn from the same main dataset. Thus any underlying probabilistic distribution of the collected and preprocessed dataset is assumed to apply to all these three pieces.\n",
    "2. Training dataset is used to develop the model. Training dataset is generally non-overlapping, or in other words, samples are drawn without replacement.\n",
    "3. Validation dataset is used to fine-tune the model. Grid search model parameters and pick the best performance based on the validation performance only. Then the testing dataset is used to actually measure the trained and tuned model. If a model does not need a validation dataset (i.e. no parameters to tune, such as Naive Bayes), then we can add the validation dataset to the training dataset.\n",
    "4. Testing dataset is used to verify and evaluate the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** Though evaluation is about measuring the performance, it is also setting the details of the model development pipeline in such a way that the exact pipeline will also be used for the **product** development or deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that through model evaluation we are making sure that what we have done as model development is correct. If there is a next project step where we **deploy** the model in a computer system (in fact it would be our actual product), so that our developed model would actually predict something, then the most common approach is using the entire dataset to train and develop the model, exactly as the evaluation pipeline is constructed. Then a possible overall approach would be use train/test/validate to build and verify the pipeline, and compute some metrics so that we can scholarly show that the developed model actually learned something and performs better than a **random** classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** If there are 5 target classes, then what is the lower-bound accuracy a random classifier would achieve?\n",

    "\n",
    "* Classification - What is the expected accuracy a model would achieve when given unseen data points and asked to predict?\n",
    "* Classification - What is the expected accuracy of individual classes and confusion between them (i.e. when the class A is truth for a particular data point, is class B is predicted, or class C is predicted?)\n",
    "* Regression - What is the total error between the regression curve (simplified model, fitted curve, etc.) and the actual data points?\n",
    "* If we are OK with a particular False-Alarm-Rate, then what is the highest accuracy we can achieve? For example, based on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve what should be our operating point.\n",
    "* What is the variation of the classification error?\n",

A good example can be as in the following: Given 20 year long dataset where we know the data is collected every day for 20 years, the training dataset can use all those 20 years. The validation dataset can use all 20 years but a percentage portion of the training (e.g. 10%). The testing dataset can be drawn from the last 5 years. Assuming the unseen data would be somewhat closer to the recent years. This kind of decisions are to be made by the model developer working with the subject matter experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-fold cross validation:** Common approach. Parameter tuning is not done but parameters are fixed throughout the entire development and evaluation. Each fold has non-overlapping test and train datasets. Average the computed accuracies for each fold and report as the accuracy. Clearly, a ML method with **good generalization** and rather **insensitive to model parameters** would work much better with this evaluation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV):** Seldom used. Similar to k-fold cross validation but testing dataset is always a single point. Recommended for very small datasets or when several outlier data points exist in the set and they are to be learned by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratification:** When target categories are unbalanced (e.g. there are more benign cases rather than malignant), then a correct validation requires the training/test datasets, or folds, preserving the percentage of samples for each class. sklearn library supports stratification fully, such as by the use of StratifiedKFold library function.\n",

    "Answer: No. We will probably never be able to know the underlying data probability distribution for practical ML problems."
