A similar framework PyTorch 1.0 has a __dynamic__ computation graph which can be updated in the run-time, thus provides more flexibility.

After successful implementation of PyTorch, TensorFlow 2.0 followed the same suit for computational graphs and this module will cover TensorFlow 2.0.\n",

    "\n",
    "## TensorFlow Architecture\n",
    "In general, popular and fast Python libraries are coded in C++ programming language for speed. The TensorFlow GPU complementary library uses Nvidia CUDA and it requires CUDA SDK and `cuDNN` libraries to be installed on a computer with CUDA capable GPU hardware available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python low-level API wraps the C++ sources and makes it possible to perform basic operations such as matrix multiplication and convolutional filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Top-level level API is made of two components, Keras and the Estimator API. Keras is a user-friendly, modular, and extensible wrapper for TensorFlow. The Estimator API contains several components that allow building ML models easily. As in any other ML methodology, in deep learning, a model usually refers to a neural network that was trained on data. Thus, a model is composed of a neural network architecture, matrix weights, and hyperparameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Convolutional Neural Networks\n",
    "We have seen the multilayer perceptrons generally composed of `fully-connected` networks, that is, each neuron in one layer is connected to all neurons in the next layer, such as in the perceptron $y=w^{\\top} x+b$. In one perspective, the _fully-connectedness_ of these networks makes them prone to overfitting data. A novel invention came out as the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which are considered regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons. The class `Dense` is the TensorFlow class encapsulating a regular fully-connected layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, CNNs take an even better approach towards regularization by taking advantage of the hierarchical pattern in data and assemble more complex-patterns by using smaller and simpler patterns, like Lego pieces. CNNs follow the connectivity patterns of neurons similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex. The receptive fields restrict the stimuli to clusters of neurons. These fields overlap to cover the complete visual field.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs require no pre-processing compared to other image classification methods because they build the features to be used for classification, which are derived/enriched/engineered features from the data. Clearly, a feature engineering is not necessary and considered as a major advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, RNNs track the temporal patterns and CNNs track the spatial patterns.\n",

    "\n",
    "The output of the network is mapped to a single binary value (not one hot encoded). So, we have to use `tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy()` and `tf.keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy()` for loss and accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case we need to create the `y` values one-hot-encoded, we can convert the `y` vector: `y_bin_tr, y_bin_ts = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_tr), tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_ts)` to be used by one-hot-encoded output.\n",
