    "# Data Features \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Given a dataset of $M$ variables and $N$ dataset points, a feature is one of the **independent** variables in a dataset and also called as a **predictor**. Generally the input to a machine learning program is a column of a tabular dataset where each row (of $N$ rows) is a dataset point in $M$ dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our Jupyter notebooks we will use the matrix $X_{N \\times M}$ as the dataset symbol without the dependent variable (also called the label, category, class, predicted variable) and we will store the dependent variable in the vector $y_{N \\times 1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$X$ is a matrix. It's rows are data points and it's columns are the features. All classifiers in `scikit-learn` can understand this data format which is based on numpy 2-dimensional arrays. Thus for each input data point we have $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M}$, and we have $N$ data points to be used in our ML pipelines. We also have $y \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ in general as the category. As an example, if we have __$K$__ categories, then $y \\in\\{k: 0 \\leq k \\leq K, k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example:__ In the following $X$ matrix we have 3 features and 5 data points, i.e. $M=3$  and $N=5$. We also have 5 values for dependent variable $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$X=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} \\\\ x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} \\\\ x_{31} & x_{32} & x_{33} \\\\ x_{41} & x_{42} & x_{43} \\\\ x_{51} & x_{52} & x_{53}\\end{array}\\right], y=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\\\ y_{3} \\\\ y_{4} \\\\ y_{5}\\end{array}\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such that in practice, $X=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}4.9 & 3 . & 1.4 \\\\ 4.7 & 3.2 & 1.3 \\\\ 4.6 & 3.1 & 1.5 \\\\ 5 . & 3.6 & 1.4 \\\\ 5.4 & 3.9 & 1.7\\end{array}\\right], y=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2\\end{array}\\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the dependent variable $y$ has levels from the alphabet $\\Sigma=\\{0,1,2\\}$, i.e. there are 3 categories in the given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predicted variable or label is the __dependent__ variable and it is dependent on the __independent__ variables or features. This amount of dependence can be sometimes high and sometimes very low depending on the dataset or the nature of the problem (again, dataset expresses this). If there is no correlation (or fully independent), then the dataset may not be suitable for the problem at hand and/or we may have to remove that feature from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, for numerical variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient of two variables $x$ (lower case x, a feature) and $y$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_{x y}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)\\left(y_{i}-\\bar{y}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(x_{i}-\\bar{x}\\right)^{2}} \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(y_{i}-\\bar{y}\\right)^{2}}}$, where $\\bar{x}$ and $\\bar{y}$ are sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we need a good correlation (close to 1 or -1) between the independent and dependent (predicted) variables so our ML model would actually work.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Question:__ Can correlation coefficient be used for determining important features for the machine learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data types\n",
    "* Numerical - Can be integer $\\mathbb{Z}$ or floating point $\\mathbb{R}$. Generally it is safe to convert all numerical variables to floating point variables.\n",
    "* Nominal - The variable values are drawn from a finite set of __levels__ or from an alphabet $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "* Binary - The variable values can be either `0` or `1` (or, `False` or `True`). Some algorithms work fast on this kind of values, especially constrained optimization related methods.\n",
    "* String - May not be used directly unless the ML program (preprocessing) knows how to deal with it\n",
    "* Date - May not be used directly unless the ML program (preprocessing) knows how to deal with it. It might be a good idea to convert (or map) dates to some integer numbers - for example, Excel handles dates in this manner.\n",
    "* More complicated features, e.g. a DNA sequence (sequence of {A,C,G,T} letters) - Other, simpler, features need to be extracted from the input sequence so that this higher-level feature can be used in an ML program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nominal to Numerical Conversion\n",
    "One possible way of converting nominal variables to numerical is one-hot encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During preprocessing count the number of levels in the set of possible levels a nominal variable $v_{nom}$ takes. Such as, $L$ different levels, $k=1, \\ldots, L$.\n",
    "2. Create $L$ binary variables for that nominal variable $v_{nom}$  where each row will have a binary zero for $L-1$ binary variables except for the $j^{th}$ level which corresponds to the level-j when $v_{nom}$ takes a value of level-j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following above procedure, a nominal variable with a cardinality of $L$ results in $L$ many binary variable creation (and dropping the original nominal variable itself). In other words, each unique level of that nominal variable is mapped to a binary variable. Note that, for the sake of this representation, storage space is wasted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also observe that the one-hot encoded variables are like unit vectors of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion of nominal variables to numerical is an important step for many numerical-only classifiers, such as neural networks, support vector machines, and linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example One-hot Encoding\n",
    "The nominal variable $T$ take levels from the $\\Sigma=\\{$ low, medium, high $\\}$. Numerical conversion involves each unique level being mapped to one of the $T_i$ binary vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "| __Nominal Variable $T$__  | $T_0$ | $T_1$ | $T_2$ |\n",
    "|---------------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n",
    "| low                       | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n",

    "| low                       | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Numerical to Nominal Conversion\n",
    "Generally, histograms, binning and bin boundaries are used to group numerical values into levels or one-hot encoded variables."
